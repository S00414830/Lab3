## Executive Summary 
Executive summary here-I could not believe how valuable this information is software and career exploration.

## Software-tells a computer what to do. Software comprises the entire set of programs, procedures, and routines associated with the operation of a computer system. System software's are compiler, assembler, debugger, driver. On other hand some examples of application software's are word processor, web browser, media player. Utility: Disk defragmenters, System Profilers, Network Managers, Application Launchers, Antivirus software, Backup software, Disk repair, Disk Cleaners, Registry Cleaners, Disk Space analyzer, file manager, File Compression, Data Security and many more. Operating System Software: Starting the computer, Providing a user interface, Managing programs. Example Task manager.

### ERP- an application that makes use of a central database that receives information from various departments within a company. The ERP includes integrated modules dedicated to functions like accounting, inventory management and CRM. An ERP gives companies a single place to store, view, manage and interpret data. Example SAP and Katana

## Virtualization-virtualization is the act of creating a virtual version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.

### Problems Solved by VirtualizationProblems solved by Virtualization.
Enhances IT processes across several fronts
Virtualization improves several aspects of IT and data management. This type of environment does wonders to recovering data, involving automatic snapshots of the virtual machines to ensure data is updated and easily recovered. Said machines can also be transferred quickly should the disaster happen to the data center itself. Just the fact that it’s a virtual environment makes it easier for cloud migration as the solution introduces cloud-like aspects to your IT. Lastly, virtualization cuts the time needed to redeploy everything in your physical server should it shut down. To sum it all up in simple terms, nearly everything is quicker and more convenient, leading to less issues upon execution.
Provides an environment for better testing
This set-up creates separate user environments for the purpose of effective testing. One dilemma when IT professionals test software and the like is how it can affect the whole network if they make a mistake. With independent user environments in place, you can do testing without the repercussions of deleting the important data of the whole enterprise. Aside from this, the snapshots mentioned earlier serve as an undo button that you can use to revert to the state of your network prior to any mistakes or deletions.
Diminishes hardware and costs
Hardware can be quite costly per piece, and this is especially apparent when you have so many assets in your network. By employing virtualization, you segment virtual machines from one server – allowing you to multitask in managing several systems. This way, you can shell out the extra funds you would have used for hardware to something else instead. You’ll get an effective solution for a cheaper price. Aside from that, it also helps you save up space in your offices. Less servers also mean less heat generated and is the most effective way to reduce said heat.
