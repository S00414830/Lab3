## Executive Summary 
Executive summary here-I could not believe how valuable this information is software and career exploration.

## Software-tells a computer what to do. Software comprises the entire set of programs, procedures, and routines associated with the operation of a computer system. System software's are compiler, assembler, debugger, driver. On other hand some examples of application software's are word processor, web browser, media player. Utility: Disk defragmenters, System Profilers, Network Managers, Application Launchers, Antivirus software, Backup software, Disk repair, Disk Cleaners, Registry Cleaners, Disk Space analyzer, file manager, File Compression, Data Security and many more. Operating System Software: Starting the computer, Providing a user interface, Managing programs. Example Task manager.

### ERP- an application that makes use of a central database that receives information from various departments within a company. The ERP includes integrated modules dedicated to functions like accounting, inventory management and CRM. An ERP gives companies a single place to store, view, manage and interpret data. Example SAP and Katana

## Virtualization-virtualization is the act of creating a virtual version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.

### Problems Solved by VirtualizationProblems solved by Virtualization.
Enhances IT processes across several fronts
Virtualization improves several aspects of IT and data management. This type of environment does wonders to recovering data, involving automatic snapshots of the virtual machines to ensure data is updated and easily recovered. Said machines can also be transferred quickly should the disaster happen to the data center itself. Just the fact that it’s a virtual environment makes it easier for cloud migration as the solution introduces cloud-like aspects to your IT. Lastly, virtualization cuts the time needed to redeploy everything in your physical server should it shut down. To sum it all up in simple terms, nearly everything is quicker and more convenient, leading to less issues upon execution.
Provides an environment for better testing
This set-up creates separate user environments for the purpose of effective testing. One dilemma when IT professionals test software and the like is how it can affect the whole network if they make a mistake. With independent user environments in place, you can do testing without the repercussions of deleting the important data of the whole enterprise. Aside from this, the snapshots mentioned earlier serve as an undo button that you can use to revert to the state of your network prior to any mistakes or deletions.
Diminishes hardware and costs
Hardware can be quite costly per piece, and this is especially apparent when you have so many assets in your network. By employing virtualization, you segment virtual machines from one server – allowing you to multitask in managing several systems. This way, you can shell out the extra funds you would have used for hardware to something else instead. You’ll get an effective solution for a cheaper price. Aside from that, it also helps you save up space in your offices. Less servers also mean less heat generated and is the most effective way to reduce said heat.Lessens the carbon footprint.

### Role of Hypervisor- creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) by abstracting a computer's software from its hardware. Hypervisors make virtualization possible by translating requests between the physical and virtual resources.

## Python-Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is a program which provides programming environment. The role of PVM is to convert the byte code instructions into machine code so the computer can execute those machine code instructions and display the output.

### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python-This pseudo-code nature of Python is one of its greatest strengths. It allows you to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the language itself. ... When you write programs in Python, you never need to bother about the low-level details such as managing the memory used by your program, etc.

### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language-
difference between an interpreted and a compiled language lies in the result of the process of interpreting or compiling. An interpreter produces a result from a program, while a compiler produces a program written in assembly language. Python is an interpreted language and not a compiled one, although compilation is a step. 

## Career Exploration-exploring possible careers and assisting with job, internship, or program searches; developing on-the-job skills (soft skills or technical skills); modeling behavior, attitudes, or skills in the workplace (job-shadowing).

### Certificates and Degrees-The main differences between certifications and college degrees are the time it takes to earn them, the cost associated, and the amount of knowledge gained during studies. That said, if you choose to take the degree path, learning shouldn't end after earning your degree. Certifications might very well be the next step in keeping your knowledge and skills fresh in your chosen IT, Tri-C Certificates and Tri-C Programs, All the certificates and degrees are offered by Tri-C I found very interesting and appealing. However, the Cybersecurity and Programming and Development post degree certificates are of short term and post degree of interest to me

### Co-ops / Internships-Co-ops are traditionally full-time, paid positions. "Internship" usually refers to a one-term work assignment, most often in the summer, but not always. Internships can be full- or part-time, paid or unpaid, depending on the employer and the career field.
